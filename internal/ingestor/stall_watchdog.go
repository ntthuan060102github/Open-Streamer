// stallWatchdog watches the time-since-last-write on a worker's
// readLoop and emits a SessionStartStallRecovery marker when the gap
// exceeds stallThreshold. The marker fronts the next packet written
// (buffer.Service auto-stamps SessionStart=true on the next write
// after SetSession), so downstream consumers (DASH packager's
// onSessionBoundary, HLS segmenter, RTSP/RTMP re-stream) flush their
// accumulated state at a clean boundary instead of accreting a giant
// per-sample dur or an A/V skew.
//
// The watchdog fires AT MOST ONCE per stall event — stallSignaled
// latches when a marker is emitted and clears as soon as a fresh
// packet write resets the lastWriteAt timestamp. This avoids a flood
// of session boundaries during a long outage.
//
// Scope: applies to all reader paths (raw-TS / AV). Raw-TS streams
// (HLS pull / SRT / UDP / file) benefit most because they bypass the
// Normaliser's MaxBehindMs re-anchor; AV-path streams already get a
// per-track re-anchor via the Normaliser but still benefit from the
// downstream session-boundary signal.
// Production defaults for the watchdog timing knobs. Pass these into
// runStallWatchdog from production call sites; tests pass shorter
// values so they don't have to sleep > 15 s of real time per case.

	// DefaultStallThreshold is the gap-since-last-write that the watchdog
	// treats as a source stall. Sources at 4 Mbps pause for 200–500 ms
	// regularly during HLS chunk fetches, and bursty HLS-pull sources
	// commonly deliver one ~6 s chunk per ~6 s of wallclock — between
	// chunks there's a ~5 s legitimate silence. A 3 s threshold fired
	// on every HLS chunk gap, producing `EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` on every
	// HLS segment and spurious `SessionStartStallRecovery` events.
	// 15 s tolerates typical HLS-pull cadence (with margin) while still
	// catching real stalls quickly enough to signal before the player's
	// buffer underruns (timeShiftBufferDepth defaults to 24 s).

// runStallWatchdog blocks until ctx is cancelled, emitting a session
// boundary on `buf` for `streamID` whenever the gap since lastWriteAt
// exceeds `threshold`. Safe to run as a goroutine alongside the
// worker's read loop; the readLoop bumps lastWriteAt on every
// successful buffer.Write.
//
// Production callers pass DefaultStallThreshold + DefaultStallCheckInterval;
// tests pass shorter values to avoid > 15 s real-time waits. Passing the
// knobs in rather than reading shared vars keeps the goroutine race-free
// across tests that override them.
